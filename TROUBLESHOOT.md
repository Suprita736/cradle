## Repository Setup Issues

### Git clone fails or times out

**Symptom:** `git clone` hangs or returns a network error.

**Fixes:**
- Check your internet connection.
- Make sure you are cloning your **fork**, not the upstream repo directly.
- Use HTTPS if SSH is blocked on your network:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cradle.git
```

- If you have 2FA enabled, use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password. See [Authentication / PAT problems](#authentication--pat-problems).

---

### Incorrect project structure after cloning

**Symptom:** Folders like `projects/` or `data/` are missing after cloning.

**Fixes:**
- Make sure you cloned the correct repository URL.
- Run `ls` (macOS/Linux) or `dir` (Windows) inside the cloned folder to confirm you are in the right directory.
- Re-clone if needed:

```bash
rm -rf cradle
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cradle.git
```

---

### Missing dependencies

**Symptom:** A project fails to load or a script throws an error about a missing module.

**Fixes:**
- Most Cradle projects are dependency-free and run directly in the browser.
- If a project includes a `package.json`, install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

- If a project includes a `requirements.txt`, install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Check the project's own `README.md` for specific setup instructions.

---

### Local server not starting

**Symptom:** `python -m http.server` command not found or fails immediately.

**Fixes:**
- Make sure Python is installed:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

- On some systems the command is `python3`:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

- If port 8000 is already in use, use a different port:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

- Then visit `http://localhost:9000` in your browser.

---

## Development Issues

### `index.html` not loading correctly

**Symptom:** The page opens but looks broken, or nothing renders at all.

**Fixes:**
- Open the browser developer console (`F12` → Console tab) and check for errors.
- Make sure you opened the file through a local server (`http://localhost:8000`), not by double-clicking the file (`file://`). Some browser security rules block scripts loaded via `file://`.
- Verify you opened the correct `index.html`. The root `index.html` is the landing page. Each project has its own `index.html` inside its folder.

---

### CSS or JavaScript changes not reflecting

**Symptom:** You edited a file but the browser still shows the old version.

**Fixes:**
- Hard-refresh the browser:
  - **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`
  - **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Open DevTools → Network tab → check **Disable cache** → reload.
- Try opening the page in a private/incognito window.

---

### Browser cache problems

**Symptom:** Old styles or scripts keep appearing even after changes.

**Fix:** Clear the browser cache entirely:
- **Chrome/Edge:** Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
- **Firefox:** Settings → Privacy → Clear Data → Cached Web Content
- Or use DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear site data.

---

### Relative path issues

**Symptom:** Images, stylesheets, or scripts return 404 errors in the console.

**Fixes:**
- Always run the project from the **repository root** using a local server, not from inside a project subfolder.
- Check that asset paths in HTML files use paths relative to that file's location, not to the root.

```html
<!-- Correct — relative to the project folder -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>

<!-- Incorrect — absolute path that breaks on different machines -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/Users/yourname/cradle/projects/games/chess/style.css">
```

- The shared `back-to-home.js` script uses a path like `../../../projects/back-to-home.js` — make sure you haven't moved any files.

---

## Build & Runtime Issues

### Python HTTP server errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `command not found: python` | Python not installed or not on PATH | Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org) or use `python3` |
| `Address already in use` | Port is occupied by another process | Use a different port: `python3 -m http.server 9000` |
| `Permission denied` | Port below 1024 requires admin rights | Use a port above 1024 (e.g. 8000, 9000) |

---

### Port already in use

**Symptom:** `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use`

**Fix — find and stop the process using the port:**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
lsof -i :8000
kill -9 <PID>

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

Or simply use a different port:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

---

### Permission denied errors

**Symptom:** Script or server fails with `Permission denied`.

**Fixes:**
- Do **not** use `sudo` to run a development server. Use a port above 1024 instead.
- On macOS/Linux, check file permissions:

```bash
ls -la
chmod 644 index.html
```

---

### Missing assets / images / icons

**Symptom:** Images or icons are broken (show as blank or 404 in the console).

**Fixes:**
- Confirm the asset file actually exists in the expected folder.
- Check the file name casing — `Logo.png` and `logo.png` are different files on Linux/macOS.
- Some projects load assets from external CDN URLs. These require an active internet connection.

---

### Broken project links on the landing page

**Symptom:** Clicking a project card on `index.html` goes to a 404 page.

**Fixes:**
- Make sure you are running the server from the **repository root**, not from inside a subfolder.
- Check `data/projects.json` — the `path` value for each project must point to the correct `index.html` relative to the root.
- Verify the project folder name matches exactly what is listed in `projects.json`.

---

## Git & GitHub Issues

### Merge conflicts

**Symptom:** `git pull` or `git merge` reports conflicts.

**Fix:**
1. Open the conflicting file(s) — Git marks conflicts with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`.
2. Manually keep the correct version and remove the conflict markers.
3. Stage the resolved file and commit:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflict in <file>"
```

---

### Push rejected

**Symptom:** `git push` fails with `rejected — non-fast-forward`.

**Fix:** Your local branch is behind the remote. Pull first, then push:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push
```

> Never force-push to shared branches.

---

### Fork out of sync

**Symptom:** Your fork is several commits behind `Facelessism/cradle:main`.

**Fix:** Sync your fork with the upstream repository:

```bash
# Add upstream remote (only needed once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Facelessism/cradle.git

# Fetch and merge upstream changes
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updated main to your fork
git push origin main
```

---

### Authentication / PAT problems

**Symptom:** `git push` asks for a password and then fails, or returns `403 Forbidden`.

**Fixes:**
- GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for Git operations. Use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**.
- Generate one at: GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate new token.
- Select the `repo` scope, set an expiry, and copy the token.
- Use the token as your password when Git prompts you, or update your remote URL:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<your-token>@github.com/<your-username>/cradle.git
```

---

## Documentation Issues

### README links not working

**Symptom:** Links inside `README.md` go to a 404 page on GitHub.

**Fixes:**
- Use **relative paths** for links within the repository:

```markdown
<!-- Correct -->
[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

<!-- Incorrect -->
[Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Facelessism/cradle/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

- Heading anchor links must exactly match the heading text (lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens):

```markdown
[Setup Issues](#repository-setup-issues)
```

---

### Markdown preview differences

**Symptom:** A Markdown file looks fine in your editor but renders differently on GitHub.

**Fixes:**
- GitHub Markdown does not support all extended Markdown syntax (e.g. some custom containers or highlight blocks).
- Stick to standard Markdown: headings, bold, italic, code blocks, tables, and lists.
- Preview your Markdown on GitHub directly by pushing the branch and viewing the file there.

---

## Browser Compatibility Tips

All Cradle projects are designed to run in modern browsers. If something looks broken:

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Styles missing | Old browser not supporting CSS variables or Grid | Update to the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari |
| Canvas not rendering | Browser does not support HTML5 Canvas | Use a modern browser |
| Web Worker not working | `file://` protocol blocks workers | Run via a local server (`http://localhost:8000`) |
| Clipboard API fails | `navigator.clipboard` requires HTTPS or localhost | Run via a local server |
| Fonts not loading | External font CDN blocked | Check your internet connection or network settings |

**Recommended browsers for development:** Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Edge (latest).

## Best Practices Before Opening an Issue

Before filing a new issue, please go through these steps:

1. **Search existing issues** — your problem may already have a fix: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Facelessism/cradle/issues).
2. **Read the relevant README** — both the root `README.md` and the project-level `README.md` if one exists.
3. **Check the browser console** — press `F12`, open the Console tab, and look for error messages.
4. **Hard-refresh the browser** — `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R` to rule out caching.
5. **Test with a local server** — open via `http://localhost:8000`, not `file://`.
6. **Confirm your branch is up to date** — run `git pull` before reporting a bug.
7. **Reproduce on a clean clone** — clone the repo fresh to rule out local environment issues.

If the issue persists after all the above, open a new issue and include:
- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Browser name and version
- Any console errors or screenshots
