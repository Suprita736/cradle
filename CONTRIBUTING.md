# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to **Cradle**! 🎉

Cradle is a collection of small ideas, experiments, lightweight prototypes, and geeky projects built for learning, exploration, and sharing. Whether you're fixing a bug, improving documentation, adding a new project, or enhancing an existing one, every contribution is appreciated.

Please take a few minutes to read these guidelines before getting started.

## Before You Start

Before working on an issue:

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicate work.
- Read the project documentation before starting.
- Wait until an issue has been assigned to you (if required by the maintainers).
- Work on only **one issue per Pull Request**.
- Keep your Pull Request focused on a **single feature or bug fix**.
- For major features or architectural changes, open an issue first to discuss your proposal.

## Adding a New Project

If you're contributing a new project, follow the repository's existing structure and keep the addition focused and self-contained.

### Where to place it

Create a new folder under the appropriate category in the `projects/` directory. Categories already include:

- `projects/aiml/`
- `projects/dev-tools/`
- `projects/games/`
- `projects/misc/`
- `projects/productivity/`

Each new project should live in its own subfolder under one of those categories.

Example:

```text
projects/games/your-project-name/
```

### Recommended project structure

A new project should usually live in its own folder with only the files it needs. A simple structure might look like this:

```text
project-name/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── README.md
├── preview.png
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    ├── icons/
    └── other-assets/
```

Use this as a guideline rather than a strict requirement:

- `index.html` — the entry point for browser-based projects.
- `style.css` — project-specific styling where applicable.
- `script.js` — project behavior and logic where applicable.
- `README.md` — short documentation covering what the project does, how to use it, and any relevant controls or credits.
- `preview.png` — a preview image when it helps the project feel complete and easier to recognize.
- `assets/` — project-specific images, icons, fonts, or other supporting resources.

Keep the project self-contained whenever possible. Avoid adding unrelated global files unless the change truly belongs to the project.

### Naming conventions

- Use lowercase folder names with hyphens when possible.
- Use descriptive, readable names that match the project purpose.
- Prefer names that are easy to understand when browsing the repository.

### Documentation requirements

Every new project should include a `README.md` inside its own folder.

A useful README usually includes:

- A short description of the project
- Key features or gameplay
- How to open or run it locally
- Controls or interaction details if relevant
- Any credits or dependencies used

Every new project should also include an `ARCHITECTURE.md` inside its own folder, following the standardized template. See [Architecture Documentation](#architecture-documentation) for full instructions.

### Assets and static files

- Store project-specific assets inside the project's own folder.
- Keep the asset layout simple and predictable.
- Avoid referencing remote assets unless they are already used elsewhere in the repository and are appropriate for the project.

### Code organization

- Keep the project-specific code isolated within its own folder.
- Use clear and descriptive file names.
- Keep the implementation readable and maintainable.
- Avoid unnecessary global styles or scripts that affect other projects.
- Add comments for non-obvious logic when helpful.

### New Project Checklist

Before opening a Pull Request, review the following checklist:

- [ ] The project is placed in the correct category directory.
- [ ] The project folder has a clear and descriptive name.
- [ ] Project-specific files are organized within the project folder.
- [ ] Assets are stored in an appropriate location.
- [ ] `README.md` has been added inside the project folder.
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` has been added following the [standardized template](ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md).
- [ ] The project works correctly locally.
- [ ] Existing projects and unrelated files were not unnecessarily modified.
- [ ] The project follows the repository's contribution guidelines.

## Coding Guidelines

Please follow the existing coding style throughout the repository.

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Use meaningful variable and file names.
- Keep code modular whenever possible.
- Avoid unrelated changes in the same Pull Request.
- Remove unused code before submitting.
- Update documentation whenever your changes affect functionality.

---

## Documentation Guidelines

Documentation is just as important as code.

You can contribute by:

- Improving explanations
- Fixing grammar or spelling
- Updating outdated information
- Adding missing documentation
- Providing examples where helpful

---

## Architecture Documentation

Every project in Cradle should include an `ARCHITECTURE.md` file inside its own folder. This helps contributors understand how a project is structured before reading any source code.

A standardized template is provided at the repository root:

```text
ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md
```

### How to use the template

1. Copy `ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md` from the repository root into your project folder.
2. Rename the copy to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. Replace every placeholder with details specific to your project.
4. Delete any section that does not apply to your project.
5. Remove the notice block at the top of the template before submitting.

### What to document

A good `ARCHITECTURE.md` covers:

- **Overview** — what the project does, in 2–4 sentences
- **Purpose & Goals** — what problem it solves or what it demonstrates
- **Folder Structure** — a tree view of all important files with inline descriptions
- **System / Project Architecture Overview** — how the major parts fit together
- **Component Breakdown** — the role of each file or module
- **Data Flow / Execution Flow** — what happens from page load to user interaction
- **Key Features** — notable features a contributor would notice
- **Technologies Used** — languages, libraries, and APIs
- **File Responsibilities** — key functions and variables per file
- **Design Decisions** — non-obvious choices and the reasoning behind them
- **Dependencies** — external libraries and how they are loaded
- **Future Improvements** — ideas without commitments
- **Known Limitations** — honest current shortcomings
- **Development Notes** — practical notes for running and modifying the project
- **References** — external resources that shaped the implementation

### Tips

- Only document what actually exists — do not invent architecture.
- Keep explanations beginner-friendly. Assume the reader is seeing the project for the first time.
- Use the arrow-step format for flow diagrams (see existing examples in `projects/games/`).
- Use tables for component breakdowns and dependency lists.

## Branch Naming Guidelines

Create a new branch for every contribution.

Use descriptive branch names following this format:

```text
feature/short-description
fix/short-description
docs/short-description
refactor/short-description
style/short-description
chore/short-description
```

Examples:

```text
feature/add-weather-widget
feature/new-project-showcase
fix/project-card-alignment
docs/update-contributing-guide
refactor/simplify-project-filter
```

Avoid generic branch names such as:

```text
update
changes
test
branch1
new
```

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

Clear and descriptive commit messages make it easier to review changes and understand project history.

Following the Conventional Commits format is recommended.

Examples:

```text
feat: add portfolio project card
fix: resolve mobile navigation issue
docs: update contributing guidelines
style: improve landing page spacing
refactor: simplify project filtering logic
```

Avoid commit messages like:

```text
update
changes
fix
misc
```

## Testing

Before submitting your Pull Request:

- Verify that your changes work as expected.
- Ensure existing functionality is not broken.
- Test responsive layouts if you modified the UI.
- Check that documentation and links render correctly.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before opening a Pull Request, make sure:

- Your branch is up to date.
- Your Pull Request addresses only one issue or feature.
- Documentation has been updated when necessary.
- The project runs successfully after your changes.
- Link the related issue using:

```text
Fixes #<issue_number>
```

If your Pull Request includes UI changes, please attach screenshots.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include:

- A clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Expected behavior.
- Actual behavior.
